# Help support the GOLD Design System

We want the Design System to be a community orientated open-source product. To encourage developers and designers to engage in the community, we accept contributions from anyone willing to donate their time.

There are several ways you can contribute:

1. Donate developer time on the [open issues](https://github.com/designsystemau/gold-design-system/issues)

2. Identify any bugs or improvements and create an issue
