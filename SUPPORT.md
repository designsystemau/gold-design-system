# Australian Government Design System - Components - Support

Stuck? Got an idea? There's several channels available to engage with the Design System community. 

We'd prefer you ask your question in the open, if possible. It's likely that others have the same question - answers posted in a public forum will assist those who come after you.

- [Post on our Community Forum](https://community.digital.gov.au/c/designsystem)
- [Join our Slack Channel](https://govau-guides.slack.com/)
- [Raise a GitHub issue](https://github.com/designsystemau/gold-design-system/issues/new/choose)

As a last resort, you can email the core development team directly at designsystem@dta.gov.au
